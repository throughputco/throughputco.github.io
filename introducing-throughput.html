            <p>A few weeks ago, I sat in on a lecture by David S. Black, Technology Partner at Oak Venture Partners about high performance cultures in software engineering. In David's mind, having a product roadmap and implementing Agile are simply not enough to succeed in highly competitive and volatile environments. Building and scaling a SaaS product (or any product, for that matter), he proposed, is analogous to building bridges during times of war. When building bridges during times of peace, the primary objective is <em>predictability</em> - finish building the bridge on time and on budget, within specifications. However, during war-time, the primary objective is speed. Get the bridge built as fast as possible, with the fewest possible resources sacrificed, without compromising quality - and then move on to the next goal. David went on to outline some of the characteristics of these high growth companies, such as Releasing Early and Often, constantly testing new product features and testing them in the wild. </p>
<p>I was intrigued by this analogy, and decided I wanted to dig deeper. There are companies that are building high quality software products at breakneck speeds, and managing to stay ahead of their competitors without compromising quality. A few examples are Dropbox, GitHub, Spotify and Netflix.</p>
<p>This blog is an attempt to highlight the tools and techniques being used by companies with high performance cultures. </p>
